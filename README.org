* TeenyTT
Teenytt is a very small, didactic proof assistant designed around
dependent type theory.
* Development
Currently, the best Haskell development tool is [[https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server][HLS]], which ought to
work with most major editors.

Note that we use [[https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/strict.html?highlight=strict#strict-by-default-data-types][-XStrictData]] by default. This is done to highlight
the key uses of lazyness, while avoiding needless clutter imposed
strictness annotations everywhere.
